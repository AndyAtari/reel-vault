# Reel Vault Sinatra Project 

For all film collectors, theaters, film preservation organizations, and movie buffs comes
a film print management app that allows users to keep track of their film collection and view other registered film prints.

A user that signs up or logs in can access their personal collection of films, add new films, edit the details of existing films, or delete prints they no longer own. Whether logged in or not, all users can search for a specific print by movie title or theater/organization. 

This project was created for Flatiron Portfolio Project Assessment and was made with Ruby Sinatra. 



## Installation

After cloning the repository, 

install bundler: 

```$ bundle```  


## Usage

In your terminal run ```$ shotgun``` and start one of Rack's supported servers. You can navigate the application through your local port. 


## Roadmap

For future releases, I plan to create a link to directly contact the owner of a film print. I hope to have the application live in the near future.
